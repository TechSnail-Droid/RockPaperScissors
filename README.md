# RockPaperScissors
Base code for a rock paper scissors game that checks the score of both the player and the computer after 5 rounds
7/26: Created a tom and jerry version of Rock Paper Scissors. I created JavaScript objects using buttons made from HTML in order to track the choices made from the user. Then I used the base game code to build the rest of the project. Including a round wins tracker and play history.
